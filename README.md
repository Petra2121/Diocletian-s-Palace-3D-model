# Diocletian-s-Palace-3D-model
3D model of original Diocletian's Palace, Split (Croatia) in Blender

Diocletian's Palace is an ancient palace built for the Roman emperor Diocletian at the turn of the fourth century AD, which today forms about half the old town of Split, Croatia. While it is referred to as a "palace" because of its intended use as the retirement residence of Diocletian, the term can be misleading as the structure is massive and more resembles a large fortress: about half of it was for Diocletian's personal use, and the rest housed the military garrison.

The 3D model is made as shown in E. Herbrand's painting "Reconstruction of Diocletian's Palace" in its original appearance upon completion in AD 305.

Each wall has a gate at its centre that's named after a metal: the northern Golden Gate, the southern Bronze Gate, the eastern Silver Gate and the western Iron Gate. Between the eastern and western gates there’s a straight road (Krešimirova, also known as Decumanus), which separated the imperial residence on the southern side, with its state rooms and temples, from the northern side, once used by soldiers and servants.
